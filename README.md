## Heretic: A New Live Algorithm
*Heretic* is an artificially intelligent computer music system to be used within the context of human-machine free improvisation. 
*Heretic* is written in the SuperCollider programming language with the machine learning aspects of the system implemented in Wekinator. 
The motivation behind *Heretic*’s inception was to create an autonomous system that uses my own improvisational methodology as a computational 
and conceptual framework for machine improvisation. To achieve this, *Heretic*’s architecture is divided into three interdependent modules: 
Interpretive Listening, Contextual Decision Making, and Musical Synthesis. Each of these modules serves an important musical function for 
the spontaneous creation of novel improvised music. When working collectively, these modules are a complete computational model of my improvisational 
methodology that interacts with human improvisers in real-time. *Heretic* is trained on my approach to improvisation, but through its interactions with a 
human performer, *Heretic*’s own improvisational voice and modes of musical expression emerge.
